/**
 * Alchemy configuration for the multi-app HOST.
 *
 * This app is the catch-all Worker: it serves the landing-grid SPA and an SPA
 * fallback for any path not claimed by a more-specific child app Worker. Child
 * mini apps live at `apps/<slug>` in this workspace, are deployed independently, and
 * bind their own route patterns (`<domain>/<slug>` + `<domain>/<slug>/*`). Cloudflare
 * resolves the most-specific route first, so child apps automatically override this
 * catch-all.
 *
 * Path-based routes only work on a Cloudflare zone (a custom domain), NOT on
 * *.workers.dev. This script always deploys to a workers.dev URL via `url: true`; the
 * custom-domain route is attached manually in the Cloudflare dashboard once the zone +
 * a proxied DNS record exist (see docs/domain-setup.md).
