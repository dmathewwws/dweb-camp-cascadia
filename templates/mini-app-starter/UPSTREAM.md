# Upstream

This folder is a vendored copy of the mini-app starter. It is **your** template —
edit it freely; `pnpm new-app <slug>` scaffolds new apps from whatever is here.

It is deliberately **excluded from the pnpm workspace** (see `pnpm-workspace.yaml`):
it still carries the generic `@starter/*` package names, and installing it would
reintroduce the name collision the monorepo exists to fix. The generator rescopes
those names to the workspace scope (root package.json name), `@<workspace>/<slug>-*`,
as it copies.

## Pulling upstream changes

Fork `antler-browser/mini-app-starter` if you want somewhere to push your own
template changes back to. To fold upstream improvements into this copy:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/antler-browser/mini-app-starter /tmp/starter
diff -ru templates/mini-app-starter /tmp/starter --exclude=.git --exclude=node_modules \
     --exclude=pnpm-lock.yaml --exclude=UPSTREAM.md
```

Apply what you want by hand, then bump the commit hash above.

Note: `pnpm setup-project --github-url … --allowed-origins …` writes your fork's
values into this copy (the footer link in `client/src/components/Footer.tsx` and
`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `alchemy.run.ts`), so the diff against upstream will show
those lines changed — that's expected; keep your values.

Note: existing apps under `apps/` are **not** retroactively updated — they diverge
from the template the moment they're generated, by design.
